# Flexbudget
Flexbudget is an application to create and use budgets the way you want. Pick your pay period ranges individually for each budget, create templates or simply have one rolling budget. It's up to you.
 

## Getting Started
Clone the repo, cd in and run `yarn run local` to get the project running on port 3000. 

This application uses Redux for state management and Firebase for a backend.
